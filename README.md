As part of the FreeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Ceritification, I created a product landing page with plain CSS. No frameworks or additional technologies used. 

Some of the things I learned while doing it:

// Used FlexBox to design a flexible responsive layout structure without using float or positioning.
// Used media queries to create different layouts depending on the size of the viewport.
// Created a sticky navbar, fully responsive.
