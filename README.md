As part of the FreeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Ceritification, I created a product landing page with plain CSS. No frameworks or additional technologies used.

Some of the things I learned while doing it:

1- Used FlexBox to design a flexible responsive layout structure without using float or positioning. 

2- Used media queries to create different layouts depending on the size of the viewport. 

3- Created a sticky navbar, fully responsive.
